## Core Features
- Pre-built docker images. Base and minimal image. See the [docker section](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoStreamRecord?tab=readme-ov-file#docker) for example startup command.
### Recorder:
- Streamer status checks bypasses rate limits; recording rate limits still under testing.
- Start, stop, and restart all recordings.
- View active recorders in real-time (More data will be added)
- Start, stop restart  individual recordings as needed.
- Add or delete streamers dynamically (no need to restart the recorder).
- Import/export streamer lists for easier management


### WebUI:
- Secure login using cookies for each client (prevents unauthorized access).
- Manage api secret keys.
- Manage multiple user accounts.
- Directly view logs and recorded videos through the WebUI.
- Watch live streams directly from the WebUI.
- Check streamer online status.
### Setup & Deployment:
- Docker configuration and service examples for straightforward deployment.
- Install [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) to run the source or build binary.
## Usage
|Username|Password|
|-|-|
|`admin`|`password`|

### Setup
__important__: You will still need to have the `internal/app` folder and it's content in the same folder structure when running this app. That means that you'll have to copy that along with any binary you build.

- Download this repo and open a terminal in this folder. Ask ChatGPT how to find the folder path and how to move into it via cli if you dont know.

#### Optional config settings
The main settings can be found in [`settings.json`](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/Recordurbate-WebUI/blob/main/internal/app/db/settings/settings.json):
```json
{
  "app": {
    "port": 8055,
    "loop_interval_in_minutes": 2,
    "video_output_folder": "videos",
    "rate_limit": {
      "enable": true,
      "time": 5
    },
  },
  "auto_reload_config": true
}
```
#### Reset password
To change forgotten password, start the program with the `reset-pwd` argument. I.e:
```
./GoRecordurbate reset-pwd admin newpassword 
```
New login for the user `admin` would then be `newpassword`

### Docker

There is two docker images available:
- [base](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoRecord-WebUI/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.base) (Full source code Ubuntu based image. Image size > 1.5GB )
- [run](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoRecord-WebUI/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.run) (Minimalistic image. Image size < 500MB )

#### Building images
Use the Makefile to build images to ensure proper tagging.
```bash
make build # Builds all
# or 
make build-base # Only base
# or 
make build-app # Only app
```

#### docker-compose.yml

##### Usage

```bash
docker compose up GoRecord -d
# or
docker compose up dev -d
```

##### Logs

Docker logs can be found using `docker logs --tail 200 -f CONTAINER_NAME`. 

#### APP (Minimalistic image)
Files / folders needed to save app settings is (only need env file to just test the container):
- [`settings`](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoRecord-WebUI/tree/main/internal/app/settings) save login, api and streamer lists.
- `output` folder for saving output videos.

App uses port __80__ by default internally.
```bash
user@hostname:~$ docker run \
  -v ./internal/db:/app/internal/db \
  -p 8050:80 \
  docker.io/lunanightbyte/gorecord:latest
```

#### Ubuntu based image


```bash
user@hostname:~$ docker run \
  -v ./:/app  \
  -p 8050:80 \
  docker.io/lunanightbyte/gorecord-base:latest
```


### Source
#### Build and run
Building the code wil create a binary for your os system. Golang is [cross-compatible](https://go.dev/wiki/GccgoCrossCompilation) for windows, linux and mac.

##### Make: 
```bash
make app
```

##### Go:
```bash
go mod init GoStreamRecord # Only run this line once
go mod tidy
go build
./GoStreamRecord #windows will have 'GoStreamRecord.exe'
```
#### Source
##### Go:
```bash
go mod init GoStreamRecord # Only run this line once
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```



## Make command list

__Note:__ This is intended to be used together with the source files.

- `make reset-pwd USERNAME=admin PASSWORD=MySecretPassword` - Resets password for the __admin__ user.
- `make app` - Builds and starts the app within the output folder
- `make build-and-push` - Builds all docker images and pushes them
- `make build-base` - Builds [base](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoRecord-WebUI/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.base) image
- `make build-app` - Builds [app](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoRecord-WebUI/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.run)  image
- `make push-base` - Pushes [base](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoRecord-WebUI/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.base) image
- `make push-app` - Pushes [app](https://github.com/luna-nightbyte/GoRecord-WebUI/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile.run)  image

## Other

### Todo

- ~~Select and delete videos~~
- Option for max video length (and size?)
- ~~headless mode without webui~~ (Abandoned because i will not create all the logic for handling the various arguments myself. Others can create a PR if they want to.)
- Move frontend to Vue
  - Btter for organizing components being re-used
- ~~Build a default docker image~~
- Individual recorders in UI
  - ~~Start/Restart individual recorders (in progress)~~
  - set max lenght/size (could be optional to use one of either)
  - view current recording length
- ~~Better video view~~
- Add support for multiple websites
### Ideas (not planned
- Log online-time of streamers and save to csv for graph plotting. Can help understand the work-hours of different streamers.
- Option to login to the streaming site and use follower list instead of config? (Unsure)
- View current videos in progress.
- Add option to try and use a custom url.

## Thanks

Special thanks to [oliverjrose99](https://github.com/oliverjrose99) for the initial inspiration and their work on [Recordurbate](https://github.com/oliverjrose99/Recordurbate). Initial code of this project was directly inspired by their project.
